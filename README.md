**Deep Learning Utilities**

This repository contains code implementations of useful functions and architectures commonly used in Deep Learning.

**Features:**

**Object Detection:**

_Non-Max Suppression (NMS):_ Eliminates redundant overlapping bounding boxes.

_Intersection over Union (IoU):_ Calculates the overlap between predicted and ground truth bounding boxes.

_Mean Average Precision (mAP):_ Evaluates the performance of object detection models.


**Neural Network Architectures**

_Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):_ Example code for image classification tasks.

_Fully Connected Networks:_ Implementations and examples.

_Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):_ Example code for sequence data.

**Examples:**

**MNIST Classification:** 

Sample code demonstrating the use of CNNs, fully connected networks, and RNNs for classifying the MNIST dataset.
